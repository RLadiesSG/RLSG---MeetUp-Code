Hello! Here's the code along for our 21 Dec 2024 meetup on Zoom. 
We went through the iris data set and covered the 5 core functions from the dplyr package. 
This R file contains the use cases for each of the 5 functions on the iris data set. 
My sincere thanks to those that turned up! 
Hope to see y'all again :)
